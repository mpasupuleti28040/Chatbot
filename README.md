# Chatbot
Django ChatterBot Terminal Client

I created this project to give myself a simple terminal-based chat interface powered up by Django and ChatterBot. With the command below, I can start a REPL in my terminal and chat with my bot.

Features

I wrote a custom Django management command (manage.py chat) in order to run everything in the terminal.

I utilized ChatterBot and included the BestMatch logic adapter.

I trained the bot on the standard English corpus so that it could respond to simple greetings and small talk.

I kept the code modular, and added comments in a first-person style, in order to make sense of everything I did.
